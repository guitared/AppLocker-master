Eclipse
=======

Sorry eclipse users, I switched to Android Studio, and you should too, it [looks like](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html) eclipse will be updated a lot less frequently if it will be at all:

> Note: If you have been using Eclipse with ADT, be aware that Android Studio is now the official IDE for Android, so you should migrate to Android Studio to receive all the latest IDE updates. For help moving projects, see Migrating to Android Studio.
